### Submit issues

### Reporting bugs

We rely on bug reports to enhance this project for all users. To assist us, we have a bug reporting template specifying the necessary details. Ensure you check our [existing bug reports](https://github.com/m-ta97/go-better-auth/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) prior to submitting a new one to avoid duplicates.

### Reporting security issues

Avoid creating a public GitHub issue for security concerns. If you discover a security vulnerability, contact us directly via email at mta.coder97@gmail.com rather than opening an issue.

### Requesting new features

To request new features, please create an issue on this project.
To ensure that we can understand the problem you are looking to solve, please be as detailed as possible.
To see what other people have already suggested, you can look [here](https://github.com/m-t-a97/go-better-auth/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement).
Please be aware that duplicate issues might already exist. If you are creating a new issue, please check existing open, or recently closed. Having a single vote for an issue is far easier for us to prioritise.

### Begin Contributing

#### Requirements

To start contributing:

- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository
- Clone the fork on your workstation:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:{YOUR_USERNAME}/go-better-auth.git

$ cd go-better-auth
```

Once you have this repo cloned to your local system, you will need to install the VSCode extension [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack).

Then run the following command from the command palette:
`Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...`

This will automatically select the workspace folder. But if you need to find the project manually then it is located at `/workspaces/go-better-auth`.

#### Development:

1. **Install Dependencies**

- Run `go mod download && go mod tidy` to install Go dependencies.

2. **Project Structure**

- Code is organized by Go Clean Architecture:
  - `domain/` – core models and interfaces
  - `usecase/` – business logic
  - `repository/` – data access implementations
  - `handler/` – HTTP/gRPC handlers
  - `infrastructure/` – external integrations

3. **Testing**

- Run unit and integration tests:

  ```bash
  # Run all tests
  make test

  # Run specific tests
  go test -v ./usecase/auth -run TestSignUp|TestSignIn
  ```

4. **Making Changes**

- Follow the project’s folder structure.
- Write tests for new features.
- Ensure all code passes linting and tests before submitting a PR.

5. **Submitting a PR**

- Push your branch and open a pull request.
- Fill out the PR template and link related issues.
